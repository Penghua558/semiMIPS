# semiMIPS
This project is to develop a 32 bit MIPS architecture CPU, the main purpose to develop such project is to improve my Verilog language skill and digital circuit
design skill. The repository contains two different implementation version of MIPS CPU, the first one I made is single clocked implementaion, the 2nd one I made
is 5-stages pipelined implementaion.
